# ADL - API Description Language

ADL is a general high level API description language that defines its own schema language as well as HTTP and RPC call
descriptions.

The syntax is derived from [RDL](https://github.com/ardielle), although the implementation has been
completely rewritten. The focus is on readability.

ADL can be used to both import and export other API definitions, for example OpenAPI, RAML, gRPC, and RDL.
