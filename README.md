# ADL - API Description Language

ADL is a general high level API description language that defines its own schema language as well as HTTP and RPC call
descriptions.

The syntax is similar to Java, and is derived from [RDL](https://github.com/ardielle), although the implementation has been
completely rewritten and somewhat modified from that.

ADL can bt used to generate other API definitions, for example Swagger, RAML, and gRPC.
